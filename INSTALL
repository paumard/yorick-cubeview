II) Copy cubeview's files to the right location
 1) system-wide installation
 2) single-user installation

                        ===================

I) Install necessary and recommended dependencies

 1) yorick

Cubeview is based on Yorick, an interpreted computing laguage. You
will need a version more recent than Dec, 20th, 2007 (the first stable
version compatible with cubeview is 2.1.05). Slightly omder versions
might do if you don't plan on using the GTK user interface. As of
writing, you almost certainly need to get the unstable tree from CVS:
see http://yorick.sourceforge.net

 2) yorick-yutils, python, pygtk, libglade

The preferred way to use Cubeview is through it's GTK interface. This
interface is build using PyGTK, a Python module which depends on
Python and libglade. In addition, bindings between Yorick and Python
are defined in the yorick-yutils package. You need version 1.3 or
above of yorick-yutils.

II) Copy cubeview's files to the right location

 In short:
   yorick -batch make.i
   make [DEST_Y_HOME=... DEST_Y_SITE=...] install

 1) system-wide installation

 - update Makefile: yorick -batch make.i

 - to install in the main yorick directories, simply type "make
   install" and you should be done. The "cubeview" script will end-up
   in Y_HOME/bin, make sure there is a link in your path.

 - you can fine-tune the installation directories using some variables.
   Either edit the Makefile or use this syntax:
     make SOME_OPTION=some/value install

   List of options with default values:

    DESTDIR=""

    DEST_Y_SITE=$(DESTDIR)/$(Y_SITE)
    DEST_Y_HOME=$(DESTDIR)/$(Y_HOME)

    BIN_DIR=$(Y_HOME)/bin
    MAN_DIR=$(Y_SITE)/man
    DEST_BIN_DIR=$(DESTDIR)/$(BIN_DIR)
    DEST_MAN_DIR=$(DESTDIR)/$(MAN_DIR)

   Y_SITE and Y_HOME above have the same values as in yorick. DESTDIR
   is mostly useful for packaging purposes.

   If Y_SITES and Y_HOMES (note the trailing "S") are defined in
   yorick, it is a good idea to install Cubeview in directories listed
   there: set DEST_Y_SITE (resp. DEST_Y_HOME) to one of the
   directories listed in Y_SITES (resp. Y_HOMES).

   Set DEST_BIN_DIR to some directory in your path
   (e.g. /usr/local/bin) and DEST_MAN_DIR to something in your
   $MANPATH (e.g. /usr/local/share/man).

   The files will be installed as follows:
    $(DEST_Y_SITE)/i:       *.i except check.i and cubeview_start.i;
    $(DEST_Y_SITE)/python:  cubeview.py (chmod a+x);
    $(DEST_Y_SITE)/glade:   cubeview.glade;
    $(DEST_Y_HOME)/i-start: cubeview_start.i
    $(DEST_BIN_DIR):        cubeview (chmod a+x);
    $(DEST_MAN_PATH)/man1:  cubeview.1.gz

 2) single user installation

It is possible to do a "system-wide" type of installation even inside
a user's home directory. See the "add_y_home" function in pathfun.i
(which comes with Yorick). A simplified installation is also possible:

 - determine what your Y_USER directory is. (enter yorick and type
   "Y_USER"). If this directory doesn't exist, create one of
   ~/Yorick/, ~/yorick/ or ~/.yorick/, whichever suites your taste
   better. It will henceforth be detected as Y_USER by Yorick; 

 - copy all *.i, *.py and *.glade files into Y_USER (check.i and
   cubeview_start.i are not required here);

 - copy cubeview_start.i into Y_USER/i-start/

 - copy the "cubeview" shell script somewhere in your path;

 - copy cubeview.1 wherever you like your manpages. You can read it
   using its full path even if it is not installed properly: e.g.
    man ./cubeview.1

 - make sure the "cubeview" shell script and the python script
   "cubeview.py" are executable: e.g. 
      chmod a+x /path/to/cubeview
      chmod a+x /path/to/cubeview.py
