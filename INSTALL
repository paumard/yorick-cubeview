I) Install necessary and recommended dependencies
 yorick, yorick-yutils, yorick-gy, gtk3
II) Copy cubeview's files to the right location
 1) system-wide installation
 2) single-user installation

                        ===================

I) Install necessary and recommended dependencies

Cubeview may be packaged for your GNU/Linux distribution. Else:

Yorick:
https://github.com/dhmunro/yorick

yorick-yutils:
https://github.com/frigaut/yorick-yutils

yorick-gy:
https://github.com/paumard/yorick-gy

Gtk+ 3:
http://www.gtk.org/

II) Copy cubeview's files to the right location

 In short:
   ./configure
   make [DEST_Y_HOME=... DEST_Y_SITE=...] install

 1) system-wide installation

 - update Makefile: yorick -batch make.i

 - to install in the main yorick directories, simply type "make
   install" and you should be done. The "cubeview" script will end-up
   in Y_HOME/bin, make sure there is a link in your path.

 - you can fine-tune the installation directories using some variables.
   Either edit the Makefile or use this syntax:
     make SOME_OPTION=some/value install

   List of options with default values:

    DESTDIR=""

    DEST_Y_SITE=$(DESTDIR)/$(Y_SITE)
    DEST_Y_HOME=$(DESTDIR)/$(Y_HOME)

    BIN_DIR=$(Y_HOME)/bin
    MAN_DIR=$(Y_SITE)/man
    DEST_BIN_DIR=$(DESTDIR)/$(BIN_DIR)
    DEST_MAN_DIR=$(DESTDIR)/$(MAN_DIR)

   Y_SITE and Y_HOME above have the same values as in yorick. DESTDIR
   is mostly useful for packaging purposes.

   If Y_SITES and Y_HOMES (note the trailing "S") are defined in
   yorick, it is a good idea to install Cubeview in directories listed
   there: set DEST_Y_SITE (resp. DEST_Y_HOME) to one of the
   directories listed in Y_SITES (resp. Y_HOMES).

   Set DEST_BIN_DIR to some directory in your path
   (e.g. /usr/local/bin) and DEST_MAN_DIR to something in your
   $MANPATH (e.g. /usr/local/share/man).

   The files will be installed as follows:
    $(DEST_Y_SITE)/i:       *.i except check.i and cubeview_start.i;
    $(DEST_Y_SITE)/glade:   cubeview.glade;
    $(DEST_Y_HOME)/i-start: cubeview_start.i
    $(DEST_BIN_DIR):        cubeview (chmod a+x);
    $(DEST_MAN_PATH)/man1:  cubeview.1.gz

 2) single user installation

It is possible to do a "system-wide" type of installation even inside
a user's home directory. See the "add_y_home" function in pathfun.i
(which comes with Yorick). A simplified installation is also possible:

 - determine what your Y_USER directory is. (enter yorick and type
   "Y_USER"). If this directory doesn't exist, create one of
   ~/Yorick/, ~/yorick/ or ~/.yorick/, whichever suites your taste
   better. It will henceforth be detected as Y_USER by Yorick; 

 - copy all *.i, and *.glade files into Y_USER (check.i and
   cubeview_start.i are not required here);

 - copy cubeview_start.i into Y_USER/i-start/

 - copy the "cubeview" shell script somewhere in your path;

 - copy cubeview.1 wherever you like your manpages. You can read it
   using its full path even if it is not installed properly: e.g.
    man ./cubeview.1

 - make sure the "cubeview" shell script is executable: e.g. 
      chmod a+x /path/to/cubeview
