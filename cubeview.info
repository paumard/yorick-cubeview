DescDetail: <<
Cubeview is a 3D FITS file viewer specialized in spectro-imaging.  
Despite this specialization, Cubeview can be used to do basic  
visualization on any FITS file containing a 3D array. It can be used  
as a stand-alone utility but, since it is written in Yorick, it is  
inherently scriptable. A system of hooks allows custom actions to be  
repeated automatically when certain events occur.
