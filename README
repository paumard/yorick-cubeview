A "cube" in the sense of Cubeview is an three-dimensional array of
numbers. Two dimensions represent spatial coordinates while the third
represents some other quantity. The axis plotted by Cubeview is really
meaningful only when the third dimension is spectral (wavelength,
frequency or radial velocity compared to a reference wavelength).

Cubeview is able to read FITS files, and to interpret them correctly
for both the now decommissioned BEAR Michelson-based spectro-imager at
the CFHT and the image-slicer-based instrument SINFONI currently
operated at the ESO VLT.

Installation

See "INSTALL" file in the source package.

Invocation 

- from a shell, use the "cubeview" script, with on optional argument
  (the name of a FITS file):
    bash$ cubeview file.fits
  When started this way, closing the GTK control window also quits
  Yorick. If cubeview is started in the foreground of a terminal
  window, you may type yorick commands throughout the session, except
  when Yorick is waiting for mouse events (selecting a spectrum and
  the like).

- from yorick:
    > #include "cubeview.i"
    > cubeview, "cube.fits"
  Cubeview's GUI is GTK based. An alternative GUI written entirely in
  Yorick is also available wen cubeview is started from yorick:
    > cubeview, "file.fits", ui="tws"
  When started from Yorick, closing the GTK window does not kill Yorick.

Read cubeview.i for more details.
